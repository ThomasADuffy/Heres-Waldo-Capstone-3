# **Introduction**
This Project is based off of my a preliminary project which can be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasADuffy/Whos-Waldo-Capstone-2). Please read it before continuing to get a full scope of my images.


Readme WIP! Please wait!, Feel free to contact me with more information!



# **How to run and utilize this app**
to create docker container, run these commands from the root of this github repo:  
**(Please note that this is very large(~3.5GB) due to the anaconda docker package being installed)**

>docker image build -t waldo_finder . 
   
>docker container run --publish 8080:8080 --detach --name waldo waldo_finder  
  
Then simply just go to the address listed in the terminal.(This will also work on an Could based instance like AWS EC2)
